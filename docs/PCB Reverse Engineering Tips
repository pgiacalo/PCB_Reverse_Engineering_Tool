PCB Reverse Engineering

1) BOM: for each of the components, list the following info in a spreadsheet
	- Designator (i.e., marking on board next to the chip)
	- Package Type*** (i.e., SOT-23, etc)  		[check google for photo identifiers]
	- Part Markings (i.e., written on the chip)	[mfg dates are 4 digit numbers: year/week or week/year]
	- Part Number (i.e., written on the chip)	
	- Research Information (brief info about the chip, based on a search of the part number/markings)

	**NOTE: Link to electronic component package types (prefixes with photos)

	TIPS on component identification:
		1) For components that are NOT marked, you may have to desolder them to get values 
			- i.e., parallel circuits, etc, prevent values to be measured accurately directly

		2) Chip/IC data sheets often contain sample application circuits. These can help identify 
		parts and values connected to the chip. 

		3) If component values cannot be determined, just leave the values blank in the BOM (for now)


2) Look for marking identifiers on the PCB next to the components
	Typical Prefix Meanings:
		Prefix 	Component type(s)
		B 	Battery or cell
		BT	Battery or cell
		C	Capacitor
		D	Diode (including Zener diodes and LEDs) 
		CR	Diode (including Zener diodes and LEDs)
		F	Fuse
		FB	Ferrite bead
		J	Connector or jack (the fixed part of a pair)
		JP	Jumper
		K	Relay or contactor
		L	Inductor or coil
		LS	Loudspeaker or buzzer
		M	Motor
		P	Connector or plug (the movable part of a pair)
		PS	Power supply
		Q	Transistor (including BJT, FET, and MOSFET)
		R	Resistor
		RN	Resistor network
		RT	Thermistor (a thermal resistor)
		S 	Switch 
		SW	Switch
		T	Transformer
		TP	Test point
		U 	Integrated circuit (IC) or assembly (or sometimes a transistor)
		IC	Integrated circuit (IC) or assembly
		V	Vacuum tube
		VR	Variable resistor (potentiometer), varistor, or voltage regulator
		X 	Crystal oscillator
		XTAL	Crystal oscillator
		Y	Crystal or oscillator
		Z	Zener diode



3) Create a block diagram of the major components

4) Use KiCad to drop each component into a new drawing, based on the components in the BOM
	This becomes your CAD parts to be moved around and connected in the subsequent schematic
