# Release Notes - v3.1

## Release Date: December 25, 2025

## New Features

### 1. Authentication System
- Implemented complete user authentication with email-based OTP (One-Time Password) login
- Secure token management with access tokens and refresh tokens stored in localStorage
- Automatic token refresh mechanism that seamlessly refreshes expired access tokens on 403 responses
- Session persistence across page reloads - users stay logged in until they explicitly log out

### 2. Authentication UI (Splash Screen)
- Full-screen login page with beautiful purple gradient matching the app theme
- Two-step authentication flow:
  - Step 1: Enter email address to receive verification code
  - Step 2: Enter 6-digit OTP code to complete login
- Real-time error and success message handling with clear visual feedback
- "Resend OTP" functionality for users who didn't receive or lost their verification code
- "Change email" option to go back and correct email address

### 3. Logout Button
- Added logout button to the top-right corner of the application header
- Semi-transparent design that fits seamlessly with the existing UI
- Hover tooltip displays the logged-in user's email address
- One-click logout that clears all authentication tokens and returns to the login screen

### 4. Development Proxy Configuration
- Added Vite proxy configuration for local development
- Proxies `/auth/*`, `/api/*`, and `/health/*` routes to the backend server
- Eliminates CORS issues during local development
- Automatic switching between proxy (development) and direct API calls (production)
