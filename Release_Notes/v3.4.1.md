# Release Notes - v3.4.1

**Release Date**: January 6, 2025

## New Features
- **Via/Pad Notes in Rollover Popup**: When hovering over vias or pads with the Option/Alt key pressed, the rollover popup now displays any associated notes along with the pin connection information.
- **Information Toolbar Button**: Added a dedicated Information button (with "I" icon) to the toolbar for quick access to the Information dialog, positioned above the Project Notes button.
- **Pattern Placement Visual Cursor**: When placing via or pad patterns, the mouse cursor now shows the appropriate via or pad icon instead of the default arrow, providing better visual feedback during pattern placement operations.

## Improvements
- **Datasheet Link Persistence**: Fixed datasheet PDF links to work correctly after project reload. Implemented lazy loading that reads the PDF from the project directory on-demand when clicked, eliminating the need to keep files in memory and providing persistent links across project sessions.
- **Enhanced AI Datasheet Extraction**: Updated AI prompts to include explicit verification instruction: "Double check to verify that the Pin Name and Pin Type is returned for every pin," improving the accuracy and completeness of datasheet extraction.
- **Splash Screen Video Update**: Changed the splash screen video from `SplashLoop.mp4` to `TrimmedPCBTracer.mp4` for a more polished user experience.
- **Keystone Transformation Controls**: Swapped arrow key directions for keystone transformations (top/bottom and left/right) for more intuitive control.
- **Slant Transformation Controls**: Swapped left/right arrow keys for slant transformation to improve usability.

## Bug Fixes
- **Datasheet Link Display**: Fixed confusing "(re-choose file to open)" messages in both Component Properties and Information dialogs. Links now work correctly after project reload, and the Information dialog displays the full datasheet path cleanly.
- **Reset Transform Functionality**: Fixed the "Reset Transform" feature to properly reset both top and bottom images to their original size and orientation as they were when first loaded.
- **localStorage Corruption Crash Prevention**: Added comprehensive error handling to prevent application crashes when localStorage is corrupted or blocked. All storage access operations (AI service configuration, API keys, model preferences) now gracefully handle errors and fall back to defaults, ensuring the application continues to function even if storage access fails. This fixes crashes that could occur when opening "File → AI Settings..." with corrupted localStorage data.
