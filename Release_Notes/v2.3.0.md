# Release Notes - v2.3.0

## Overview
Version 2.3.0 focuses on improvements to the Project Notes / TODO List feature, including enhanced UI/UX and better visual design.

## UI/UX Improvements

### Project Notes / TODO List Enhancements
- **Column Title Updates**: Changed column headers from "Name" and "Value" to "Item" and "Notes" for better clarity
- **Actions Column**: Removed "Actions" column title, leaving it blank since Delete buttons are self-explanatory
- **Visual Improvements**: 
  - Removed gap between dialog header and table header for a cleaner, more integrated look
  - Added custom scrollbar styling with distinct visual appearance (grey track with darker thumb)
  - Scrollbar now clearly differentiated from the rest of the dialog box
  - Table header is flush with dialog title (no spacing)

### Scrollbar Styling
- Custom scrollbar design with:
  - 12px width for better visibility
  - Light grey track background (`#f0f0f0`) with left border (`#ddd`)
  - Dark grey thumb (`#888`) with rounded corners and border
  - Hover effect (darker grey `#666`)
  - Firefox support via `scrollbarWidth` and `scrollbarColor` properties

## Technical Improvements

### Code Organization
